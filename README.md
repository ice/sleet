## Sleet Syntax Highlight
A [Sublime Text 2/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) / [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) bundle for Sleet Template Engine.

### Installation via Package Control
If you have Sublime [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/docs/usage), you know what to do. If not, well: it's a package manager for Sublime Text; and it's awesome.

After installing the Package Control and restarting the editor:
* Open the Command Pallete (ctrl+shift+P or cmd+shift+P).
* Type _Install Package_ and hit return.
* Find _Sleet_ and hit return.
